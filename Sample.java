// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach

//Problem 1: Implement Stack using Array

//Time Complexity : O(1) for each action, Insiertion, Deletion, Peek..
//Space Complexity : O(n) No of input elements to be pushed to stack
// Any problem you faced while coding this : No


//Problem 2: Implement Stack using LinkedList

//Time Complexity : O(1) for each action, Insiertion, Deletion, Peek..
//Space Complexity : O(n) No of input elements to be pushed to stack
// Any problem you faced while coding this : No


//Problem 3: Implement Singly LinkedList

//Time Complexity : Takes O(n) time as we have to traverse the list and insert the element at the end. Same for printing the list as well.
//Space Complexity : O(n) No of input elements in the List
// Any problem you faced while coding this : No


//problem 4: Insert an element in binary tree

//Time Complexity : For 1 element instertion it would take O(log n) as per the height of the tree.
//Space Complexity: Space complexity would also be O(log n) as parent nodes as to be pushed to the queue to insert the new node.
// Any problem you faced while coding this : No
