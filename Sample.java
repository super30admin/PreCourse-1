// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : couldn't find this exact problem
// Any problem you faced while coding this : infinite loop, some edge cases.


// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
/*first, made a list of all the operations that a stack can do.
then started writing code with few edge cases.
ran the code and saw the output and got to identify new edge cases.
made changes to the code.
