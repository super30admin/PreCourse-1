Time Complexity :
  isEmpty : O(1)
  push    : It is list append  : Average case O(1) and worst case Amortized O(1) refer https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity
  pop     : It is list pop last element :   Average case O(1) and worst is amortized O(1)
  peek    : O(1)
  size    : O(1)
  show    : O(N)

Space Complexity:
  isEmpty : O(1)
  push    : O(1)
  pop     : O(1)
  peek    : O(1)
  size    : O(1)
  show    : O(N)

Did this code successfully run on Leetcode :
  Yes
Any problem you faced while coding this :
  Not clear about show, but understood as list of all values , went with shallow copy
