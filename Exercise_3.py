#Exercise 3 : Implement singly Linked List

#Time Complexity : The time complexity for all of the methods(except initialization) mentioned below is O(N), as for every operation we have to traverse the length of the linked list, and 
#unlike stack it is not constant time operation.


#Space Complexity : The space complexity is O(N) as it will increase as the number of elements(length) of the linked list increases.
