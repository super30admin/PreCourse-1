/*Time Complexity: The overall time complexity is O(1) for all he operations
push() operation : inserting the item into the top of the stack(i.e at the head of linkedlist) takes O(1) time.
pop() operation : Checking for underflow and returning the poped item from stack(i.e at the head of linkedlist) takes O(1) time.
peek() operation :  looking and getting the top element from stack(i.e at the head of linkedlist) takes O(1) time.
hemce the overall time complexity is O(1).
Space Complexity :  As there is no extra space (any other data structure), the space complexity is O(1).

Did this code successfully run on Leetcode :
I could'nt find this problem in leetcode hence I executed in an IDE. At first when I ran this code I got error class for main not declared,
then I include the public specifier for the constructor after which it successfully executed.

Any problem you faced while coding this :
I had difficulity in figuring out that all the items should be inserted and deleted at the head but was inserting and deleting at the tail which could
cause O(n) complexity.
