//Time Complexity  : O(1) as one operations will be performed at a time. Either push, pop, or peek
//Space Complexity : O(n) where n is the size of the elements in array. As n number of elements can we inserted and that much space can be utilized.
// approach is brute force we are just incrementing and decrementing the top according to operations needed to be performed.
// Didnt solved in leetcode but solved using online compiler
